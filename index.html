melons functionality and has tasked your team with planning
and designing it.</p>

Okay,

It seems like people are obsessed with rating things, so we
need to make sure we have a feature where customers can rate
melons that we carry.

It's essential to make sure that all of our users can access
this new feature so it HAS TO BE RESPONSIVE!!

We've got a wireframe going, but we still need the bootstrap.
Can you put complete the html with the needed html and bootstrap?

The base of the page and a little bootstrap already exist.

You only need to make one row of content to rate. Later we'll
code a loop to create multiple rows.

Use the placeholder image included and lorem ipsum for the
text for now.

Things you need to have:
    - Navbar with modal window for login
    - Responsive columns with placeholders
    - Account for both mobile and desktop layouts

<strong>Remember, time is money, so use the Bootstrap docs and example
code to quickly prototype.</strong>

Hey! Maybe we should built an internal tool to rate our customers!
I'll put together a focus group on it.

See you next week,

Mel
